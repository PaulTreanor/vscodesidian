# Dev Notes

## Running the extension

1. Run `npm run compile`
2. Open codebase in VSCode (other editors, even Cursor, won't work).
3. From VSCode: Run `Start Debugger` command from cmd palette.

## Run unit tests

`npx vitest run`

I am using more test files than is necessary to avoid annoying mocks leaking between tests.
This is a side project and I can't spend time on very trivial testing mock issues please forgive me.
